Wail source code
by Charles Lechasseur


Finally!

Well, i've been promising this for far too long. Here's the source code to Wail at last.

The project was built with CodeWarrior Pro 4, with all the patches. The Wail binaries I distribute were built with PowerPlant 1.9.3 (the patched Pro 4 version) with the official PP 1.9.3 errata. I used the Universal Headers supplied with Pro 4 and its patches, i have not upgraded to the latest version.

The code *should* be pretty straightforward, I guess. It uses PowerPlant heavily and is not all that generic (the early classes like CWailDocWindow and CWailSoundFileData are a bit ugly). It gets better toward the end... :)

It does include some fairly useful generic classes, like a Window menu manager attachment (CWindowTracker/CTrackableWindow), a scratch disk system (CVirtualMemoryManager) and a wrapper for various sound manager structures (CSoundChannel and CJukebox).

I released the code because now that Aleph One is progressing nicely, perhaps people will find some use in this code as an inspiration for other MacOS-based editors. I wish it wouldn't be tied to the MacOS so much since it makes it difficult to port to other platforms, but it's a start.

Wail also uses code taken from the MoreFiles package. MoreFiles is a collection of file-related routines made by Apple. It is distributed with the Wail source code but is covered by its own license (compatible with the Wail license); see the file named "!MoreFilesReadme" in the MoreFiles source folder for details.
